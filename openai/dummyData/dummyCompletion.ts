      "question": "What is a linear transformation?",
      "answer": "A linear transformation is a rule which turns vectors into other vectors, satisfying the rules: T(cu) = cT(u) and T(u+v) = T(u)+T(v). It is called a linear transformation because it maps straight lines to straight lines."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the geometric meaning of a linear transformation?",
      "answer": "A linear transformation has a definite geometric meaning: it turns straight lines into other straight lines. In a sense, linear algebra is a branch of geometry."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the matrix of a linear transformation?",
      "answer": "The matrix of a linear transformation relative to ˆi,ˆj is defined as the first column telling what happened to ˆi, and the second column telling what happened to ˆj."
